This revision focuses on improving the security and \nreliability of software updates and patches in response to Executive Order 14306 on strengthening \nthe Nation’s cybersecurity.  \nSP 800-53 Release 5.2.0 addresses multiple aspects of the software development and deployment \nprocess, including software and system resiliency by design, developer testing, the deployment \nand management of updates, and software integrity and validation. This update also revises the \ndiscussion sections of some existing controls to provide additional scoping and implementation \nexamples. A detailed list of changes is included below in Table 1.  \nNIST SP 800-53A Release 5.2.0, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Information Systems \nand Organizations, includes updates to assessment procedures for new or revised control and \ncontrol requirements.  NIST SP 800-53B Release 5.2.0, Control Baselines for Information Systems \nand Organizations, has no changes; the version number was updated for consistency with SP 800-\n53 and SP 800-53A.   \nTable 1.
