  "content": "**Implement Strong Access Control Measures**\n\nThis Guide provides supplemental information that does not replace or supersede PCI SSC Security Standards or their supporting documents. 10 Tools for Assessing Compliance with PCI DSS The PCI SSC sets the PCI Security Standards, but each payment card brand has its own program for compliance, validation levels and enforcement. For more information about compliance programs, contact the payment brands or your acquiring bank. Qualified Assessors. The Council manages programs that will help facilitate the assessment of compliance with PCI DSS: Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) and Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV). QSAs are approved by the Council to assess compliance with the PCI DSS. ASVs are approved by the Council to validate adherence to the PCI DSS scan requirements by performing vulnerability scans of Internet-facing environments of merchants and service providers. The Council also provides PCI DSS training for Internal Security Assessors (ISAs). Additional details can be found on our website at: www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/index.php. Self-Assessment Questionnaire. The Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) is a validation tool for eligible organizations who self-assess their PCI DSS compliance and who are not required to submit a Report on Compliance (ROC). Different SAQs are available for various business environments; more details can be found on our website at: www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_ library?category=saqs#. To determine whether you should complete a SAQ (and if so, which one), contact your organization’s acquiring financial institution or payment card brand."
